# MS SQL-DB-Connect
.net desktop app, which attach,create connection,change sql auth,create user and permisstion to ur DB, by easy way :)
if you  develope desktop Apps which connect to DB, you face many things that waste time when copy this app to ur client or friend.
i'm trying to help u and me to finish our work quickly

things like
attach db to server
change language of ur db
if u work with local network u may need to sql auth and user
so that i developed fuctions for that: 
Change_SQL_Server_authentication
createUser
CreateLogin
createPermission
and finally generate txt file has ur connection string, copy string and past it in ur app.

just past MS-DB_Connect app next to ur DBs and it will loop and attach,,, them 

Finnaly i need ur feedback to develop next version of this App which can help more peoples.
