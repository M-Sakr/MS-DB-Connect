# MS SQL-DB-Connect

.net desktop app, which can attach,create connection,change sql auth,create user and permission to ur DB in one step.
if you develop desktop Apps which connect to DB, you could face many things that waste time when copy this app to another machine. 

this project can help to :
attach db to server, change language of ur db.
if u work with local network u may need to sql auth and user so that i developed functions for that: Change SQL Server authentication ,create User ,Create Login ,create Permission ,and finally generate txt file has ur connection string, copy string and past it in ur app.

just past MS-DB_Connect app next to ur DBs and it will loop and attach,,, them if not work run it as Administrator.
